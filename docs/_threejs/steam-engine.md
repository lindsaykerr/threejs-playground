description: 'Test to see how components can move in unison'
summary: '<p>I wanted to figure out how multiple moving can be animated together within threejs. I chose an old-style industrial steam engine as the subject. While it is not overly complex, the parts must work in sync to give an accurate representation of a mechanical piece of machinery. In three.js this can be achieved by syncing one animation action with others.</p> 
<p>This project also allowed me to get familiar with the animation system of three.js.</p>'
